Resume Builder in React

Overview
This project is a Resume Builder application developed using React. It allows users to create professional resumes by entering their personal information and selecting from various templates. The data remains consistent across different templates, providing flexibility and ease of use.

Features
Template Selection: Choose from multiple resume templates such as Amsterdam, Chicago, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
Data Entry Forms: Fill out the forms on the right side for Personal Information, Skills, Education, and Experience.
Dynamic Updates: The entered data is dynamically updated across all selected templates.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with easy navigation and clear instructions.
State Management
This project uses the Context API for state management. The Context API allows for efficient state handling and sharing of data across different components without the need for prop drilling.

How It Works
Create Context: A context is created to hold the state and provide it to the components that need access to it.
Provider Component: A provider component wraps the parts of the application that need access to the state. It supplies the state and functions to update it.
Consumer Components: Components that need access to the state use the useContext hook to consume the context.

How to Use
Select a Template: Choose your preferred resume template from the left side of the application.
Enter Information: Fill out the forms on the right side for Personal Information, Skills, Education, and Experience.
Preview and Edit: Preview your resume in the selected template and make any necessary edits.
Download/Print: Once satisfied, download or print your resume.
Additional Information
Customization: Users can add more sections or information as needed.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on various devices.
